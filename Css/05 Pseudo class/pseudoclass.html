   <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.</p>
    <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
     button:hover {<br>
         color: blue;<br>
     }<br>
    </p>
 <p>A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parenthesis to define the arguments (e.g., :dir()). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., button in case button:hover).</p>
